==================
Hi, I'm Timmycodin
==================

I’m Timmy, a code-slinging, keyboard-smashing, curiosity-chasing dev-in-progress, and a Georgia Tech class farmer (summer camps ofc, 2025: Lego Robotics)
I landed in the beautiful chaos where code, caffeine, and way-too-many tabs collide called Github.
Welcome to my GitHub! Stay awhile. Or don’t. I can’t stop you 😎

=========
Interests
=========

- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence** – I wanna make machines smarter than my math teacher.
- 💻 **Web Development** – Because web dev is 30% coding, 70% Googling.
- 🎮 **Game Development** – Making games that make people rage.
- 📱 **Mobile Apps** – Pocket power, baby.
- ⚙️ **Automation** – Laziness is the mother of all inventions.
- 🌐 **Open Source** – I break it, I fix it, I share it.
